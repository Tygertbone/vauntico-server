**Today: How to get PAID by brands to post content you're already creating.**

## 🎯 What is a Brand Partnership?

**Brand partnership = Company pays you to promote their product/service**

**What they pay for:**
- Dedicated video featuring their product
- Product reviews
- Sponsored posts
- Brand mentions in your content
- Attending their events

**What you get:**
- Cash (R500-5,000+ per post)
- Free products
- Long-term partnerships (monthly retainers)

---

## 💰 How Much Can You Earn?

### **By follower count (African market rates):**

**100-1,000 followers:**
- R300-800 per post
- Free products (worth R200-500)

**1,000-5,000 followers:**
- R800-2,000 per post
- Products + cash

**5,000-10,000 followers:**
- R2,000-5,000 per post
- Retainer deals (R3K-8K/month)

**10,000+ followers:**
- R5,000-15,000 per post
- Major brand campaigns

**You don't need 10K followers. Start pitching at 500+.**

---

## 🏢 Types of Brand Partnerships

### **Type #1: Micro-Influencer Deals**
Small/local brands work with creators under 5K followers.

**Examples:**
- Local clothing boutique (R500 per post)
- African beauty brand (R800 + free products)
- Local restaurant (R600 + free meal)

**Easiest to land. Start here.**

---

### **Type #2: Affiliate + Bonus**
Brand gives you affiliate link + pays you extra to create content.

**Example:**
- Luno: R100 per sign-up (affiliate) + R1,500 for creating 3 promotional videos

---

### **Type #3: Product Seeding**
Brand sends free product. You review it (no payment, but free stuff).

**Why do this:**
- Builds portfolio
- Relationship with brand (leads to paid deals later)
- Content for your page

---

### **Type #4: Retainer Partnership**
Monthly agreement. You post X times per month for consistent income.

**Example:**
- R3,000/month to post 4 videos featuring their products
- Steady income, easier planning

---

## 🌍 What Brands Look For

### **✅ Engagement over followers:**
1,000 engaged followers > 10,000 passive followers

**They check:**
- Comments (real conversations?)
- Shares (people spreading your content?)
- Views relative to followers (are people watching?)

---

### **✅ Authentic content:**
Brands don't want ads. They want YOU promoting naturally.

**Bad:** "Buy this product now! Link in bio!"  
**Good:** "I've been using [product] for 3 weeks and here's what I noticed..."

---

### **✅ Niche alignment:**
Fitness brand → partners with fitness creators  
Fashion brand → partners with fashion creators

**Stay in your niche. Makes pitching easier.**

---

### **✅ Professionalism:**
- Clear communication
- Meet deadlines
- Deliver quality content
- Easy to work with

## 🚀 Real Example: Thando's First Brand Deal

**Thando** (Fashion, 1,200 followers, South Africa)

**Month 2:**
- Emailed 10 local SA clothing brands
- 3 responded
- 1 offered deal

**The Deal:**
- Brand: Local Johannesburg boutique
- Deliverable: 1 Instagram Reel showing 3 outfit changes
- Payment: R800 + R500 store credit
- Timeline: Create & post within 7 days

**Day 1:** Filmed 3 outfits (30 min)  
**Day 2:** Edited video (1 hour)  
**Day 3:** Sent to brand for approval  
**Day 4:** Approved, posted  
**Day 10:** R800 paid via EFT

**Result:**
- R800 for 2 hours work = R400/hour
- Used R500 credit for new clothes (content for future videos!)
- Brand asked for monthly partnership (4 posts/month for R2,500)

**Her lesson:** "I was scared to pitch. I wish I started sooner!"

## ⚠️ Brand Deal Red Flags

### **🚩 Red Flag #1: "We'll pay you in exposure"**
Exposure doesn't pay bills.  
**Response:** "I appreciate the offer, but I only work on paid partnerships."

### **🚩 Red Flag #2: "Post 10 times for R500"**
Underpaying for excessive work.  
**Response:** "My rate is R500 per post. I can do 2 posts for R1,000."

### **🚩 Red Flag #3: No contract/agreement**
Always get it in writing.  
**Response:** "Great! Can we formalize this in a brief agreement? I'll send a template."

### **🚩 Red Flag #4: "Promote our competitor's competitor"**
Exclusivity that limits your income.  
**Response:** "I'm open to this, but my rate increases for exclusivity."

### **🚩 Red Flag #5: Brand asks you to buy product first**
You're the influencer. They send YOU product.  
**Response:** "I work on gifted product partnerships. Happy to review if you'd like to send!"
