## 💰 Pricing Strategy

**Don't undercharge. Your time is valuable.**

**Beginner pricing:**
- 1-hour consultation: R500-800
- Monthly coaching: R800-1,500
- One-time service: R400-1,000

**After 5 clients, raise prices by 20-30%.**

**Formula:**  
(Hours worked × R200) + (Value of results × 3)

Example: 2-hour service that saves client R3,000 = (2 × R200) + (R3,000 × 0.3) = R400 + R900 = R1,300

## 📣 How to Sell Services

### **Method #1: Content + CTA**

**Post video about your niche**  
End with: "Need personal help with this? DM me 'HELP' for my 1-on-1 service!"

### **Method #2: Story of Transformation**

"I helped [client name] [achieve result]. Want the same? DM me!"

### **Method #3: FAQ Post**

"5 questions I get asked: [list]. If you need personalized answers, DM me for a consultation!"

### **Method #4: Limited Spots**

"Opening 3 coaching spots for January. DM me 'COACHING' if interested!"

(Scarcity = urgency)
