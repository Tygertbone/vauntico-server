## 🎯 The Anatomy of a Winning Pitch

**A good pitch has 5 parts:**

1. **Attention-Grabbing Subject/Opening**
2. **Who You Are** (brief)
3. **Why Them** (show you know their brand)
4. **What You Offer** (value proposition)
5. **Clear CTA** (next step)

**Keep it SHORT. 150-200 words max.**

## ⚠️ Pitch Mistakes to Avoid

### **❌ Mistake #1: "I have 200 followers, pay me R5,000"**

Be realistic about your rates based on your reach.

### **❌ Mistake #2: Copy-paste generic pitch**

Brands can tell. Personalize every pitch.

### **❌ Mistake #3: "I need money, please hire me"**

Focus on what YOU offer THEM, not your needs.

### **❌ Mistake #4: No follow-up**

If no response in 5-7 days, send ONE polite follow-up.

### **❌ Mistake #5: Pitching competitors simultaneously**

Don't tell Nike you're also pitching Adidas. Keep it separate.

---

## 📈 The Pitch Process (Step-by-Step)

### **Day 1 (Today): Send 10 pitches**

- 5 emails
- 5 Instagram DMs
- Track in spreadsheet

### **Day 3: Follow up on no-responses**

Simple: "Hi [Brand], following up on my message from [Day]. Still interested in chatting!"

### **Day 5-7: Responses come in**

- Some will say yes
- Some will say no
- Some will ghost (that's okay!)

### **Success rate: 10-30%**

If you pitch 10 brands, expect 1-3 to respond positively.

**That's 1-3 deals from ONE day of work!**

## 🌍 Real Example: Kofi's Pitch Success

**Kofi** (Finance niche, 850 followers, Ghana)

**Week 1:**

- Sent 15 pitches (10 local Accra businesses, 5 Pan-African brands)
- 4 responded positively
- 11 no response/rejection

**Deals closed:**

1. **Local bank (Accra):** R600 for 2 TikTok videos
2. **MTN Ghana:** Free data + R400 for Instagram Reel
3. **Local restaurant:** Free meal + R300 for review video

**Total Week 1: R1,300 + free stuff**

**His lesson:** "I was scared to pitch. Turns out brands WANT content creators. Just ask!"

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Higher Response Rates

### **Tip #1: Pitch on Monday-Wednesday**

Brands check emails early in the week. Fridays get buried.

### **Tip #2: Show your best work first**

"Recent post: [Link to your top video]"

### **Tip #3: Make it easy to say yes**

"I can have content ready by [specific date]"

### **Tip #4: Follow up ONCE**

No response after 7 days + 1 follow-up = move on

### **Tip #5: Start local, scale global**

Local businesses respond faster. Build portfolio, then pitch bigger brands.
