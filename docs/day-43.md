# Day 43: Hiring Your First VA 👥

## YOU CAN'T SCALE ALONE

**Your time = your most valuable asset.**

**When you're making R2,000+/month, it's time to hire help.**

---

## 🎯 When to Hire Your First VA

### **Signs you're ready:**

✅ **You're making R2,500+/month consistently**  
✅ **You're spending 5+ hours/week on admin tasks**  
✅ **You're turning down opportunities (no time)**  
✅ **You're working 20+ hours/week**  
✅ **Hiring would free you to earn MORE**

**Math:**  
Hire VA for R1,500/month → Frees 20 hours/month → You earn R2,000+ more = NET +R500/month + less stress
