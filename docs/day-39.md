## 🚀 Scaling Strategy #1: Raise Your Prices

**The fastest way to scale: Charge more.**

**Example:**

**Current:**
- 5 clients × R500/month = R2,500

**After raising prices 40%:**
- 5 clients × R700/month = R3,500
- Same work, R1,000 more

---

### **When to raise prices:**

✅ **After 10-20 clients/sales**
- You have testimonials
- Demand is proven

✅ **When booked out**
- If you're turning people away, raise prices
- Higher price = fewer clients, same income

✅ **Every 3-6 months**
- Your skills improve
- Your value increases

---

### **How much to raise:**

**Conservative:** 10-20% every 6 months  
**Aggressive:** 30-50% when you add value (bonuses, certification, etc)

**New customers pay new price. Existing customers stay at old price (loyalty reward).**

---

## 🚀 Scaling Strategy #2: Create Higher-Ticket Offers

**Selling R150 products:**
- Need 14 sales for R2,000
- Lots of customer service
- High effort

**Selling R1,500 service:**
- Need 2 clients for R3,000
- Deeper work, better results
- Higher satisfaction

---

---

### **How to sell high-ticket:**

**Step 1: Build authority**
- 3-6 months of consistent content
- Case studies/results
- Social proof

**Step 2: Qualify leads**

**Step 3: Consultation call**

- 30-60 min call to understand needs
- Customize solution

**Step 4: Proposal**

- Investment
- Payment plan option

## 🚀 Scaling Strategy #3: Group Programs

**Offer this when you have 2,000+ followers and proven results.**
