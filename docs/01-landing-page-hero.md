## The Wound: What Creators Face

You've built. You've shipped. You've hustled.  
But every platform takes a cut. Every tool locks you in. Every "guru" sells you templates without teaching you truth.

**You're tired of:**

- Renting power from platforms that change rules overnight
- Cobbling together tools that don't talk to each other
- Building audiences you don't own on land you'll never control
- Creating content that disappears into the algorithm void

**You crave:**

- Ownership. Full-stack. No middlemen.
- Systems that teach while they serve
- A vault where your journey becomes immortal lore
- Revenue that compounds, not just clicks that vanish

_This is not another SaaS subscription._  
_This is your forge. Your vault. Your legacy engine._
