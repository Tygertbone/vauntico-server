# Vauntico Monetization Roadmap (Claude's Strategy)

## Strategic Pivot
- Vauntico is positioned as trust infrastructure for the creator economy.
- Distinctive opportunity: Vauntico as "Stripe for creator credibility" with moats in AI trust scoring, sacred features, Ubuntu philosophy, and African market focus.
- Monetization reframed around Vauntico Credits (store credits, not blockchain tokens).

## Phases (Reordered)
1. **Foundation (Months 1–6)**
   - Free trust score calculator (viral growth).
   - $49/month Pro subscription (sacred features).
   - $19/month Score Insurance add-on (alerts, smoothing, priority support).
   - Target: $100K MRR from creators.

2. **B2B API Licensing (Months 7–12)**
   - Trust Score API tiers ($99–$2,999/month).
   - White-label widgets for platforms.
   - Brand partnership integrations.
   - Target: $500K MRR from businesses.
   - ⚡ Strongest monetization phase (Stripe moment).

3. **Enterprise Compliance (Months 13–18)**
   - African compliance suite ($2K–$10K/month).
   - Slack/Notion integrations.
   - Agency white-label solutions.
   - Target: $300K MRR.

4. **Creator Economy (Months 19–24)**
   - Ubuntu Council (brand commissions).
   - Legacy Sponsorships (native advertising).
   - Sacred feature marketplace.
   - Target: $200K MRR.

5. **Vauntico Credits (Months 25–30)**
   - Credits earned through validated trust-building actions (maintaining scores, referrals, tutorials).
   - Redeem credits for Pro subscriptions, leaderboard placement, custom badges, or discounts.
   - Creators can gift credits.
   - Bundles sold at margin (100 credits for $79).
   - Target: $100K MRR.

## Projection
- $1.2M MRR in 30 months ($14.4M ARR).

## Blind Spots & Mitigations
- **Data privacy:** Transparent scoring algorithm, opt-in public scores, right to explanation.
- **Platform dependency:** Multi-platform scoring, fallback estimated scores, manual verification.
- **Gaming the algorithm:** Anomaly detection, decay functions, manual audits ($99 review).
- **Commoditization:** Sacred features + Ubuntu Echo community as moat, move up value chain to predictions.
