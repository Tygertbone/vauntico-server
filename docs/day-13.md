# Day 13: Analytics 101 📊

## WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS IMPROVED

**You've been posting for almost 2 weeks. Now it's time to look at the DATA.**

**Most creators:**
- Post and hope
- Have no idea what's working
- Repeat the same mistakes
- Wonder why they're not growing

**Pro creators:**
- Track every metric
- Double down on what works
- Cut what doesn't
- Grow 10X faster

**Today, you become a data-driven creator.**

## 📊 Why Analytics Matter

**Analytics tell you:**
- ✅ Which videos work (so you make more of them)
- ✅ Which hooks stop the scroll (so you use them again)
- ✅ When to post (when your audience is online)
- ✅ Who your audience is (so you speak directly to them)
- ✅ What to sell (based on what they engage with most)

**Without analytics = flying blind**  
**With analytics = strategic growth**

## 🎯 The 8 Metrics That Matter

### **Metric #1: Views/Reach**

**What it is:** How many people saw your video

**Where to find it:**
- TikTok: Analytics → Content → Video views
- Instagram: Insights → Content → Reach

**What it means:**
- 0-100 views = Video died in Stage 1 (weak hook/engagement)
- 100-1,000 views = Normal for small accounts
- 1,000-10,000 views = Good! Algorithm is pushing you
- 10,000+ views = Viral territory!

**Action:** Identify your top 3 most-viewed videos. What do they have in common? (Topic? Hook? Length?)

---

### **Metric #2: Watch Time / Average Watch Percentage**

**What it is:** How long people watched (as % of total video)

**Where to find it:**
- TikTok: Analytics → Content → [Select video] → Average watch time
- Instagram: Insights → Content → [Select post] → Retention

**What it means:**
- 70%+ = EXCELLENT (algorithm loves this)
- 50-70% = Good
- 30-50% = Average
- <30% = Bad (weak hook or too long)

**Action:** Find your highest watch time video. What made people watch til the end?

---

### **Metric #3: Engagement Rate**

**What it is:** (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) ÷ Views × 100

**How to calculate:**
- Video with 1,000 views, 50 likes, 10 comments, 5 shares, 3 saves = 68 engagements
- 68 ÷ 1,000 × 100 = 6.8% engagement rate

**What it means:**
- 8%+ = AMAZING! Viral potential
- 5-8% = Very good
- 3-5% = Average
- <3% = Content needs improvement

**Action:** Calculate engagement rate for your last 5 videos. Which had the highest? Why?

---

### **Metric #4: Follower Growth**

**What it is:** How many followers you gain per day/week

**Where to find it:**
- TikTok: Analytics → Overview → Follower growth
- Instagram: Insights → Total followers → See all

**What it means:**
- 0-5 followers/day = Early stage (normal!)
- 5-20 followers/day = Growing steadily
- 20-100 followers/day = Strong growth
- 100+ followers/day = Viral growth

**Action:** Track which videos brought the most followers. Make more of that content!

---

### **Metric #5: Profile Visits**

**What it is:** How many people clicked your profile after watching

**Where to find it:**
- TikTok: Analytics → Overview → Profile views
- Instagram: Insights → Overview → Profile visits

**What it means:**
- High profile visits = People want to know more about you
- Profile visits → Followers → Customers (the funnel!)

**Action:** Optimize your bio and pinned videos (people are checking you out!)

---

### **Metric #6: Traffic Source**

**What it is:** Where your views came from

**Where to find it:**
- TikTok: Analytics → Followers → Traffic source
- Instagram: Insights → Content → [Select post] → Reach → Source

**What it means:**
- **"For You" / "Explore"** = Algorithm pushed it (GOOD!)
- **"Following"** = Only your followers saw it (algorithm didn't push it)
- **"Personal profile"** = People visited your page
- **"Hashtags"** = Found you via hashtags
- **"Sound"** = Found you via trending audio

**Action:** If most views are from "Following" only → work on hooks and engagement (algorithm isn't pushing)

---

### **Metric #7: Audience Demographics**

**What it is:** Age, gender, location of your followers

**Where to find it:**
- TikTok: Analytics → Followers → Gender/Age/Top territories
- Instagram: Insights → Total followers → Demographics

**What it means:**
- Know WHO you're speaking to
- Tailor content to their specific needs
- Price offers based on their location (African vs global)

**Action:** Write down your top 3 audience demographics. Does your content speak to them?

---

### **Metric #8: Most Active Times**

**What it is:** When your followers are online

**Where to find it:**
- TikTok: Analytics → Followers → Follower activity
- Instagram: Insights → Total followers → Most active times

**What it means:**
- Post when your audience is online = better Stage 1 performance
- Wrong timing = video dies before it gets traction

**Action:** Set reminders to post during your top 3 most active times.
