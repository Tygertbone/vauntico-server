## 🎨 Brand Voice Maintained

The scroll adheres to Vauntico's mythic voice:

✅ Words like "forge," "ritual," "syndicate," "empire"

## 💬 Sample Agency Pitch (from Scroll)

> _"Before we build your new site, let's run our Brand Health Diagnostic—a comprehensive audit of your current digital presence. We'll identify what's working, what's costing you conversions, and where quick wins live. Investment: R8,500. Timeline: 5 business days."_

This positions the audit as proprietary expertise, not a third-party tool.
