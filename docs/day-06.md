## 📝 Caption Formula

```
[HOOK LINE] (grab attention in 1 sentence)

[VALUE] (what they'll learn in 2-3 sentences)

[CTA] (tell them what to do)

[HASHTAGS] (3-5 relevant ones)
```

**Example:**
```
Want to save R500 this week? 💰

These 3 free apps changed my life. I went from broke to R2K/month savings. No BS, just results.

## #️⃣ Hashtag Strategy

**Use 3-5 hashtags (not 30!):**

1. **1 Mega tag** (1M+ posts): #ContentCreator #MoneyTok
2. **2 Medium tags** (100K-500K): #NigerianCreators #AfricanBusiness
3. **2 Niche tags** (10K-50K): #LagosHustle #NairobiStartups

**Why this works:** Balance of reach + relevance
