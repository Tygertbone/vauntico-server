## 📊 Week 4 Key Lessons

### **Lesson #1: Monetization Starts Small**

You don't go from R0 → R10,000 overnight.  
First R500, then R1,000, then R2,000.  
**Every rand counts.**

### **Lesson #2: You Have to ASK**

People won't buy if you don't ask them to.  
"DM me" = the most important CTA.

### **Lesson #3: Sales = Conversations**

The sale happens in DMs, not in posts.  
Posts attract. DMs convert.

### **Lesson #4: Multiple Streams Win**

Affiliate + Product + Service = R2,000 is EASY.  
R600 + R800 + R600 = R2,000 ✅

### **Lesson #5: Pricing Psychology Matters**

R149 sells better than R150.  
3-tier pricing sells better than 1 option.  
**Test and optimize.**
