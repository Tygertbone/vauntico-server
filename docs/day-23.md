## 💰 How to Price Your Digital Product

**Too cheap (R20-50):** "This must be low quality"  
**Too expensive (R1,000+):** "Too risky for my first purchase"  
**Sweet spot (R100-400):** "Affordable impulse buy, seems valuable"

### **Pricing by Product Type:**

**Checklists/Templates:** R50-150  
**Guides/Ebooks:** R150-300  
**Video courses:** R300-600  
**Bundles:** R400-800

### **Your First Product:** R150-250
- Low enough that people buy without overthinking
- High enough to be taken seriously
- Room for upsells later

### **The "Coffee Test":**
If your product costs less than 2 coffees (R100-150), it's an easy "yes" for most people.
