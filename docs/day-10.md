# Day 10: Hook Library 🎣

## THE FIRST 3 SECONDS DETERMINE EVERYTHING

**You have 7 videos filmed. But here's the truth:**

**If your first 3 seconds don't hook viewers, they scroll past.**

No matter how good your content is.

**The Hook = The difference between:**
- 47 views vs 47,000 views
- 2 followers vs 200 followers
- R0 vs R2,000/month

**Today, you're building your Hook Library - 50 proven templates you'll use forever.**

## 🎯 What Is a Hook?

**Hook = The first 1-3 seconds of your video that makes people STOP scrolling**

**Bad hook example:**
"Hey guys, welcome back to my channel, today I'm going to show you..."

**Result:** Scrolled past in 0.5 seconds.

**Good hook example:**
"I lost 20kg using ONLY my phone. Here's how..."

**Result:** Viewers STOP. They WATCH. Algorithm pushes video.

## 🧠 The Psychology of Hooks

Hooks work because they trigger one of these emotions:

1. **Curiosity** ("The #1 mistake keeping you broke...")
2. **Shock** ("I made R5,000 in 3 days. Here's proof...")
3. **Relatability** ("If you're tired of being broke, watch this...")
4. **Urgency** ("Do this before February ends or lose money...")
5. **Controversy** ("Everyone says save money. I say spend more...")
6. **Promise** ("3 steps to gain 1,000 followers this week...")

**Every viral video uses at least ONE of these emotions in the first 3 seconds.**

✅ **Start with hook:** "I made R2,000 in 3 days..."

❌ **Being vague:** "I'm going to teach you something today..."
