# Day 3: Your First Viral Script 📝

## Today's Mission

**Write 3 scripts guaranteed to get engagement using the formula that's generated 500M+ views for African creators.**

---

## 📚 The Viral Formula

Every viral video follows this structure:

```
HOOK (0-3 seconds) → Get attention
VALUE (3-27 seconds) → Deliver promise
CTA (27-30 seconds) → Tell them what to do next
```

**Why this works:**
- First 3 seconds = 80% of people decide to keep watching
- Value = Why they watch till the end
- CTA = Turns viewers into followers

---

## 🎯 The Hook Formula

**Your hook must answer: "Why should I keep watching?"**

### **7 Proven Hook Templates:**

1. **The Big Promise**
   - "Here's how I made R500 in one day"
   - "I grew from 0 to 10K followers in 30 days"

2. **The Mistake**
   - "I wasted R5,000 before learning this"
   - "Don't make this beginner mistake"

3. **The Secret**
   - "Nobody tells you this about content creation"
   - "The truth about making money online in Nigeria"

4. **The Question**
   - "Want to make R2,000/month with your phone?"
   - "Know the #1 mistake new creators make?"

5. **The Story Start**
   - "Last week I was broke. Today I made R1,000"
   - "This changed everything for me"

6. **The List**
   - "3 free apps that made me money"
   - "5 mistakes killing your growth"

7. **The Controversy**
   - "Everyone's wrong about content creation"
   - "Stop following this bad advice"
