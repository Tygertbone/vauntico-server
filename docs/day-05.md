# Day 5: Master CapCut Editing 🎨

## Today's Mission

**Turn your raw footage into a professional video using CapCut.**

1. Open CapCut
2. Tap "New Project"
3. Select Take 2 from yesterday
4. Tap "Add"

## ✂️ Basic Editing (30 min)

### **Step 1: Trim the Fat**
- Cut beginning (before you start talking)
- Cut end (after you finish)
- Remove long pauses (tap clip → Split → Delete)

**Target length:** 27-30 seconds

### **Step 2: Add Captions** (Auto!)
- Tap "Text" → "Auto Captions"
- Select language (English/Swahili/etc)

- Tap "Audio" → "Sounds"
- Search "trending"
- Pick one that fits your vibe
- Lower volume to 20% (your voice should be louder)

- Add text overlay for key points
- Use transitions (but don't overdo it)

### **Color Grade:**
