## The CLI: Your Command Throne

**Philosophy:** Speak your vision. Watch infrastructure materialize.

### Core Commands

```bash
# Generate a complete landing page
vauntico generate landing \
  --style mythic \
  --purpose "workshop signup" \
  --cta "Begin Ascension"

# Output: Fully coded HTML/CSS/JS + deployment ready
```

```bash
# Create a workshop outline
vauntico workshop create \
  --title "Master the Funnel" \
  --duration "6 weeks" \
  --transformation "confident funnel builder"

# Output: Curriculum, exercises, marketing copy
```

```bash
# Run a comprehensive audit
vauntico audit run \
  --url https://example.com \
  --pillars technical,seo,conversion \
  --format scroll

# Output: Narrative report + priority roadmap
```

```bash
# Generate scroll-style content
vauntico scroll write \
  --topic "Email Marketing Fundamentals" \
  --tone "mythic, empowering" \
  --length 2000

# Output: Long-form content ready to publish
```

### What Makes It Different

**1. Narrative-First Generation**
- Outputs read like scrolls, not code dumps
- Every component comes with implementation lore
- Comments explain WHY, not just WHAT

**2. Context-Aware Intelligence**
- CLI learns your style over time
- Remembers previous projects for consistency
- Suggests based on your industry/niche

**3. Full-Stack Ownership**
- Export everything: code, assets, content
- No vendor lock-in
- Deploy anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, self-hosted)

**4. Teaching While Building**
- Each generation includes mini-tutorial
- Optional "explain mode" for learning
- Links to deeper scrolls for mastery

## The Credit Economy: Sustainable Power

### Why Credits?

**Problem with unlimited plans:**
- Encourages waste
- Subsidizes power users at expense of casual users
- Makes pricing unsustainable

**Credits solve this:**
- Pay for what you use
- Rollover prevents loss (Pro/Legacy)
- Clear cost per action
- Budget predictably

### Credit Pricing by Action

| Action | Credits | Real Cost (Pro tier) |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Landing page (standard) | 50 | R20 |
| Landing page (complex) | 100 | R40 |
| Workshop module | 100 | R40 |
| Full workshop (8 weeks) | 600 | R240 |
| Technical audit | 250 | R100 |
| Scroll (1000 words) | 40 | R16 |
| Component generation | 30 | R12 |
| Full funnel (4 pages) | 200 | R80 |

**Calculation:** Pro tier = R999/2500 credits = R0.40/credit

### Smart Credit Features

**Usage Alerts:**
- Warning at 80% monthly allocation
- Notification at 100%
- Pause option to prevent overage

**Rollover Logic:**
- Starter: No rollover (encourages regular use)
- Pro: 1,000 credit cap (prevents hoarding, keeps commitment)
- Legacy: Unlimited (true vault building)

**Family Sharing (Pro/Legacy):**
- Share credit pool with team members
- Role-based access controls
- Unified billing, separate usage tracking
