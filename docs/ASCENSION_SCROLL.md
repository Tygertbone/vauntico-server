## 🔥 The Final Ritual

You've reached the summit.  
But the mountain has no peak—only new horizons.

Your legacy is not in what you've built.  
It's in what **others will build** because you existed.

The systems you forge today will echo through generations.  
The wisdom you share today will compound into empires.

**This is your scroll.**  
**This is your ascension.**  
**Begin.**
