# Day 42: Repurposing Content 🔄

## ONE VIDEO. TEN PLATFORMS. INFINITE REACH.

**You film ONE video (10 minutes of work).**

**Most creators:** Post to TikTok. Done.  
**You:** Turn it into 10+ pieces of content.

**Today: The repurposing system that 10X's your reach.**

---

## 🎯 Why Repurposing Matters

**Without repurposing:**

- 1 video = 1,000 views (TikTok only)
- Reach: 1,000 people

**With repurposing:**

- Same video → 10 platforms
- 10,000+ total views
- Reach: 10,000 people

**Same effort. 10X the reach. 10X the income opportunity.**
