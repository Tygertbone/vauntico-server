# Day 25: Pricing Strategy 💎

## PRICING = PSYCHOLOGY

**Price too low:** Look cheap, attract difficult clients, make no money  
**Price too high:** Scare everyone away  
**Price RIGHT:** Attract quality clients, make R2K+/month

**Today: The psychology of pricing + your pricing strategy.**

---

## 🧠 Pricing Psychology Principles

### **Principle #1: Anchor Pricing**

**Show a higher price first, then your actual price:**

❌ "My course is R300"  
✅ "My course has R800 value. Launch price: R300 (save R500!)"

People perceive R300 as a deal when anchored against R800.

---

### **Principle #2: The "9" Effect**

R297 feels cheaper than R300 (even though it's R3 difference)

**Use:**

- R149 (not R150)
- R297 (not R300)
- R497 (not R500)

---

### **Principle #3: Price = Perceived Value**

**R50 ebook:** "Probably low quality"  
**R200 ebook:** "Must be good if they charge this much"

**Don't undercharge. It signals low value.**

---

### **Principle #4: The 3-Option Rule**

Always offer 3 tiers:

- **Cheap option:** Few buy (makes middle look reasonable)
- **Middle option:** Most buy (the "goldilocks")
- **Expensive option:** Some buy (increases average price)

**Example:**

- Basic: R300
- Standard: R500 ← MOST CHOOSE THIS
- Premium: R900

Offer: "R300 one-time OR 3 × R120" (total R360)

**Why this works:**

- Lower barrier to entry
- You make more (R360 vs R300)
- More people say yes

**Use payment plan services:**

- Paystack (supports recurring)
- Manual (trust-based - they pay weekly via bank transfer)

## 🌍 African Market Considerations

**Income varies by country:**

- **Nigeria/Kenya:** Middle class can afford R150-400 easily
- **South Africa:** R300-600 is accessible
- **Zimbabwe/Ghana:** R100-300 sweet spot

**Adjust based on YOUR audience location (check analytics).**

**Pro tip:** Create "local currency" offers:

- R300 (South Africa)
- 5,000 Naira (Nigeria)
- 2,000 KSH (Kenya)

People buy more when price is in their currency.

## ⚠️ Pricing Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Matching competitor prices** → Race to the bottom  
✅ **Price based on YOUR value**

❌ **Charging R50 because "people are broke"** → Attracts wrong clients  
✅ **Charge fair price** → Attracts serious people

❌ **Never raising prices** → You stay broke  
✅ **Raise every 10-20 customers**

❌ **One price only** → Limits sales  
✅ **3-tier system** → More options, more sales
