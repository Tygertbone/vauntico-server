## 🎯 The 100 Follower Milestone

**Have you hit 100+ followers yet?**

**Why 100 followers matters:**

- Algorithm starts taking you seriously
- Momentum builds faster from here
- You're ready to monetize (even with 100 followers!)

**If you're not at 100 yet:**
- Review Day 13 (Analytics) - find what works
- Double down on your top-performing content
- Post 5-7 videos next week using your winning formula
- You'll hit 100 by end of Week 3

## 💡 Week 2 Key Lessons

### **Lesson #1: Consistency > Perfection**
- Your Week 1 videos probably sucked. Week 2 are better. Week 3 will be even better.
- Don't wait for "perfect" - publish and improve.

### **Lesson #2: The Algorithm Rewards Strategy**
- Random posting = random results
- Strategic posting (right hooks, engagement tactics, peak times) = consistent growth

### **Lesson #3: Engagement = Money**
- Views are vanity. Engagement is currency.
- 500 engaged followers > 5,000 passive followers

### **Lesson #4: Your Data Tells You What to Do**
- Stop guessing. Start tracking.
- Your analytics show you exactly what works.

### **Lesson #5: Batch Systems = Sustainability**
- You can't film 1 video/day forever (burnout).
- Batch filming = you can sustain this for MONTHS (and hit R2K/month).
