# Day 4: Film Your First Video 🎬

## Today's Mission

**Film Script 1 using your phone. No retakes anxiety - we'll make it perfect.**

---

## 📚 Filming Best Practices

**Before you hit record:**

### **The 5-Minute Setup:**
1. **Clean your lens** (shirt corner works)
2. **Set up tripod** (DIY from Day 2)
3. **Check lighting** (face the window)
4. **Test audio** (record 5 seconds, play back)
5. **Frame yourself** (head + shoulders in shot)

---

## 🎯 The Perfect Frame

**Rule of Thirds:**
- Imagine 2 lines dividing screen into 3 parts
- Put your eyes on the top line
- Leave space above head (not too much)

**Distance:**
- **2-3 feet from camera** (arm's length)
- Close enough for good audio
- Far enough to show hand gestures

## 🎬 Filming Process

### **Take 1: The Messy Draft** (20 min)

Just say the script. Don't worry about perfection.

**Common mistakes (TOTALLY NORMAL):**
- Forget lines → Pause, restart that sentence
- Stutter → Keep going, fix in edit
- Noise in background → Wait, reshoot that part

**Pro tip:** Film in 10-second chunks, not all at once.

---

### **Take 2: The Polish** (20 min)

Now that you know the script, film it smoother:
- Smile at start (looks more confident)
- Speak slightly slower (clearer audio)
- Use hand gestures (more engaging)
- Look at camera lens, not screen

---

### **Take 3: The Backup** (10 min)

Film one more time (trust me on this).

**Why?**
- Sometimes Take 2 has issues you didn't notice
- Having options makes editing easier
- Confidence grows each take (Take 3 is usually best)
