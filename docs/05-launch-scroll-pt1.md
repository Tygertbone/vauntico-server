**👋 I'm Tyrone, and I built Vauntico in the trenches.**

Not in Silicon Valley. Not with VC money.  
On a small farm in Mahikeng, South Africa, bartering code for survival, trading skills for clarity.

**The wound I was scratching:**

Every creator I knew was renting power.  
- Platforms that changed algorithms overnight
- Tools that locked them in
- "Gurus" selling templates without teaching truth

I wanted something different: **Systems that teach while they serve.**

**What Vauntico Actually Is:**

🔧 **CLI:** Generate landing pages, funnels, content—mythic infrastructure in minutes  
📚 **Workshop Kit:** Turn expertise into structured, sellable courses  
🔍 **Audit-as-a-Service:** Offer high-value audits (technical, SEO, conversion) to clients  
🎫 **Creator Pass:** Credit-based, 3-tier system (Starter/Pro/Legacy)

**Why It's Different:**

1. **Narrative AI:** Outputs aren't just functional—they're scroll-worthy
2. **Full Ownership:** Every line of code, every asset, yours forever
3. **Teaching Built In:** Tools that explain while they build
4. **White-Label Ready:** Agencies can resell under their brand

**Who It's For:**

- Solo creators building their first digital empire
- Agencies scaling client work without scaling headcount
- Coaches/consultants monetizing expertise through workshops
- Anyone tired of renting power from platforms

**The Guarantee:**

30-day full refund if Vauntico doesn't elevate your craft.  
No tricks. Just creators honoring creators.

**Special Offer for Product Hunt:**

First 100 supporters get **Founder Pricing:** 30% off for life, any tier.  
Use code: **FORGE100**

Ask me anything. Every question gets a scroll-level answer.

Let's build legacy together. 🔥

— Tyrone
