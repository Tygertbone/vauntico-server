# Day 44: Email List Building 📧

## OWN YOUR AUDIENCE

**TikTok can ban you. Instagram can shadow-ban you. Your email list? YOURS FOREVER.**

Today: Build the asset that NO platform can take away.

## 🎯 Why Email Lists Matter

**Social media:** Algorithm controls who sees your content  
**Email list:** YOU control who sees your message

**1,000 followers = maybe 100 see your post**  
**1,000 email subscribers = 300-500 open your email**

**Email list = Higher engagement, more control, more sales.**
