### 🎭 The Soul Surfacing Philosophy

Phase 3 embodies the transition from **infrastructure to expression**. Where Phase 1 laid foundations and Phase 2 deployed infrastructure, Phase 3 **surfaces the soul** — the unique value propositions that make Vauntico distinct:

- **Dream Mover** — Not just "AI generation," but content *transformation*
- **Workshop Kit** — Not just "templates," but *ritual scrolls* and *blueprints*
- **Audit Service** — Not just "code review," but *git archaeology* and *health scoring*
- **Add-ons** — Not just "upsells," but *syndication* and *ecosystem building*

This mythic framing creates **emotional resonance** while maintaining **operational clarity** — users understand what they're buying, but feel they're joining something larger.
