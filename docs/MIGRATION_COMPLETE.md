## 📖 The Vauntico Voice

From the Agency Scroll:

> _"These scrolls are not instructions. They are **incantations.** Speak them into existence: Copy becomes website. Frameworks become funnels. Stories become movements."_

The lore vault preserves this mythic voice—ensuring every word survives, every framework endures, every invocation remains accessible to those who build with Vauntico.

## ✨ The Forge Remembers

_"What was scattered is now gathered._  
_What was hidden is now enshrined._  
_The scrolls have found their home._  
_The lore vault is complete."_
