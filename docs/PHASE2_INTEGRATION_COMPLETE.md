## ⚡ PERFORMANCE NOTES:

### Desktop:
- Should run smoothly (60fps)
- All animations are GPU-accelerated

### Mobile:
- Unicorn still shows (smaller)
- Reduced glyphs automatically
- Nebula less intense
- Everything still responsive

### If Laggy:
You can reduce intensity by editing the pages:
```jsx
// Reduce glyph density:
<FloatingGlyphs density="low" /> // instead of "medium" or "high"

// Hide unicorn trail:
<EnhancedUnicorn showTrail={false} />

// Disable sacred geometry animation:
<SacredGeometry animate={false} />
```
