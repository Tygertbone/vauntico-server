# The Agency Scroll
## Resell the Ritual. White-Label the Wisdom. Scale with Clients.

---

## 🧭 The Revelation

Agencies don't just serve clients.  
They **syndicate systems**.

Every website you build, every funnel you deploy, every brand you elevate—these aren't just deliverables.  
They're **invocations.**

But here's the ancient truth most agencies forget:
**Your clients don't just need execution—they need ongoing transformation.**

Vauntico transforms your agency from project-based contractor into **legacy builder**.  
From "we made your site" to "we power your empire."

This isn't white-label.  
It's **soul-label**—products and systems that carry your brand, embody your wisdom, and scale your impact without scaling your headcount.

## 📚 Agency Playbook: Best Practices

### Positioning Strategy

**❌ Don't Say:**
- "We use Vauntico for audits"
- "Powered by third-party tools"
- "White-label service provider"

**✅ Do Say:**
- "Our proprietary diagnostic framework"
- "Built on enterprise-grade infrastructure"
- "Our Brand Health System™"

**Branding Principle:**
> Clients pay for YOUR expertise and brand, not the tools. Position Vauntico as your secret weapon, not your product.

---

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchor High:**
- Lead with enterprise pricing (R15K audits)
- Make mid-tier (R8.5K) feel like a deal
- Position entry-level (R5K) as "starter diagnostic"

**Bundle Smart:**
- Audit + Workshop: 15% discount
- Audit + Implementation: 20% discount
- Full Stack (Audit + Workshop + Distribution): 25% discount

**Create Urgency:**
- "Limited slots this month"
- "Launch special pricing"
- "First audit free with annual retainer"

---

### Service Delivery Excellence

**Under-Promise, Over-Deliver:**
- Promise 5-day audit turnaround, deliver in 3
- Include bonus recommendations
- Add video walkthrough even if not paid extra
- Follow up 30 days later with progress check

**Communication Cadence:**
- **Day 0:** Confirm engagement, set expectations
- **Day 2:** Update on progress
- **Day 4:** Preview key findings
- **Day 5:** Deliver full report + walkthrough
- **Day 30:** Follow-up check-in
- **Day 90:** Offer re-audit to measure improvement

---

### Upsell Framework

**Audit → Implementation:**
> *"Your audit revealed R45K/month in conversion leaks. Want us to fix them? Implementation package: R6,999/month for 3 months, guaranteed ROI or refund."*

**Workshop → Ongoing Management:**
> *"Your workshop is live. Want us to manage ongoing enrollments, email sequences, and optimizations? Management retainer: R1,999/month."*

**One-Time → Retainer:**
> *"Instead of annual audits, consider monthly monitoring. We'll catch issues before they become problems. R3,999/month vs. R12K/year for annual audits."*

---

## ❓ FAQ: Agency Edition

### Can I resell under my own brand?
**Yes.** With Pro or Legacy tier, you have full white-label rights. Your clients never see "Vauntico"—only your brand.

### What if a client asks about the technology?
**Positioning options:**
1. "We built our audit engine on proprietary infrastructure."
2. "We partner with enterprise-grade platforms for scalability."
3. "Our system is powered by best-in-class APIs."

All are true. Choose what fits your brand.

### Can I charge more than suggested pricing?
**Absolutely.** Suggested pricing is conservative. If you have premium positioning, charge R20K+ for audits. Your value = your expertise + delivery + results, not just the tool.

### What if I need custom features?
**Legacy tier includes:**
- Quarterly strategy calls with Vauntico team
- Custom feature requests prioritized
- API access for custom integrations
- Dedicated Slack channel

### Can I white-label for other agencies?
**Yes.** If you want to become a Vauntico reseller (offering it to other agencies), contact us for partnership terms. Revenue share available.

### What's the affiliate commission?
**15% recurring** on all referrals. If you refer a Legacy subscriber (R2,999/month), you earn R449.85/month for as long as they stay subscribed.

### Do I need technical skills?
**No.** The dashboard is point-and-click. CLI is optional (but powerful if you have devs). Most agencies use the web interface exclusively.

### Can I offer audits without Legacy tier?
**Yes.** Pro tier includes 1 audit/quarter (2,500 credits total). But for agency-scale volume (10+ audits/month), Legacy is essential.

### What if my client wants direct access?
**Two models:**
1. **Agency-managed:** You run audits, deliver reports (most agencies choose this)
2. **Client-access:** Give them branded portal access, charge monthly seat fee

Both work. Choose based on your service model.

### How do credits work for agencies?
**Legacy tier = 10,000 credits/month** with unlimited rollover. Average audit = 250 credits. So you can run ~40 audits/month, or mix audits + workshops + scrolls.
