# Day 33: Negotiation Tactics 💪

## NEGOTIATION ADDS R500-1,000 PER DEAL

**Scenario 1:** Brand offers R500. You accept. Deal: R500.  
**Scenario 2:** Brand offers R500. You negotiate. Deal: R800.

**Same work. R300 more. Just by negotiating.**

**Today: Master negotiation. Never leave money on the table.**

---

## 🎯 The Negotiation Mindset

**❌ Scarcity:** "I'm lucky they want to work with me"  
✅ **Abundance:** "We're partners creating value together"

**❌ Fear:** "If I ask for more, they'll walk away"  
✅ **Confidence:** "I deliver results. I deserve fair payment"

**Remember: Brands have BUDGETS. They expect negotiation.**

## 💼 The 5 Negotiation Scenarios

### **SCENARIO #1: They Offer Too Low**

**Brand:** "We can pay R300 for a video"  
**Your rate:** R800

**❌ Bad response:** "Okay!"  
**❌ Bad response:** "That's insulting! No way!"

**✅ Good response:**
```
"Thanks for reaching out! My standard rate for video content is R800 based on my reach and engagement rates.

I'd love to work together - is there flexibility in the budget? Or we could reduce deliverables to fit R300 (e.g., Instagram Story instead of Reel)."
```

**What this does:**
- States your value
- Shows willingness to work together
- Offers alternative
- Doesn't insult them

---

### **SCENARIO #2: They Want "Exposure" Payment**

**Brand:** "We can't pay, but this is great exposure!"

**❌ Bad response:** "Okay, I'll do it for free"

**✅ Good response:**
```
"I appreciate the opportunity! I've moved to paid partnerships only, but I'd be happy to discuss a gifted product collaboration where you send [product] and I create content.

Alternatively, if budget opens up, here's my rate card: [link]"
```

**When to accept "exposure":**
- ONLY if it's a MAJOR brand (100K+ followers themselves)
- ONLY if you're under 500 followers
- ONLY once or twice (build portfolio, then charge)

---

### **SCENARIO #3: They Accept Your Rate Too Quickly**

**You:** "My rate is R800"  
**Brand:** "Perfect! Let's do it"

**What this means:** You could have charged R1,200.

**Next time:** Start 20% higher. "My rate is R1,000"

**They'll either:**
- Accept (you make more!)
- Counter with R800 (you "compromise" to your original rate)

---

### **SCENARIO #4: They Want Extra Deliverables**

**Brand:** "Can you do 3 videos instead of 1 for R800?"

**❌ Bad response:** "Sure!"

**✅ Good response:**
```
"My rate is R800 per video, so 3 videos would be R2,400.

However, I can offer a package discount:
- 3 videos for R2,000 (save R400!)

Would that work?"
```

**Always charge for extra work. ALWAYS.**

---

### **SCENARIO #5: They Want Usage Rights**

**Brand:** "Can we repost your video on our accounts?"

**This is worth money!**

**✅ Response:**
```
"Absolutely! Usage rights are typically an additional fee:

- 30 days: +R200
- 90 days: +R400
- 1 year: +R800

Which works best for you?"
```

**Why:** Your content has value beyond one post. Charge for it.

---

## 🤝 The Negotiation Framework

### **Step 1: Anchor High**
Start 20-30% above your minimum acceptable price.

**Your minimum:** R600  
**Your ask:** R800  
**Likely result:** R700-800

---

### **Step 2: Justify Your Price**
Never just say a number. Explain WHY.

**Bad:** "R800"  
**Good:** "R800, which reflects my [X] engaged followers, [Y]% engagement rate, and proven results driving sales for similar brands."

---

### **Step 3: Show Flexibility**
Don't be rigid. Offer options.

**Option A:** Full deliverable at full price  
**Option B:** Reduced deliverable at their budget  
**Option C:** Payment plan / trade

---

### **Step 4: Know Your Walk-Away Number**
Decide BEFORE negotiating: What's your minimum?

**Example:**
- Ideal: R1,000
- Acceptable: R700
- Walk away: Anything under R500

**If they offer R400:** Politely decline. Your time is worth more.

---

### **Step 5: Get It In Writing**
**Always. No exceptions.**

After verbal agreement:
```
"Great! Let me send over a brief agreement to confirm:

- Deliverables: [X]
- Timeline: [Y]
- Payment: R[Z]
- Payment terms: 50% upfront, 50% upon posting

Reply to confirm and we'll get started!"
```

---

## 💬 Negotiation Scripts

### **Script #1: Counter a Low Offer**
```
"Thanks for the offer! My rate for this type of content is R[your rate] based on my audience size and engagement.

I'd love to make this work - is there room in the budget to meet closer to R[your rate]?

Alternatively, I can adjust deliverables to fit your budget. What works best?"
```

---

### **Script #2: Ask for More Than Offered**
```
"I'm excited about this opportunity! Based on the scope, my rate would be R[your rate].

This includes:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

Does that align with your budget?"
```

---

### **Script #3: Politely Decline Low Offer**
```
"Thank you for considering me! Unfortunately, R[their offer] is below my minimum rate for video content.

If budget opens up or you'd like to discuss a different scope, I'd love to reconnect!

Wishing you success with your campaign!"
```

**Stay polite. They might come back later with better budget.**

---

### **Script #4: Negotiate Payment Terms**
```
"I'm on board! For projects over R[X], I typically require:
- 50% deposit before content creation
- 50% balance within 7 days of posting

This protects both of us. Does that work?"
```

## 🌍 Real Example: Wanjiku's Negotiation Win

**Wanjiku** (Finance, 980 followers, Kenya)

**Brand offer:** R400 for Instagram Reel

**Old Wanjiku:** Would have accepted immediately.

**New Wanjiku (after Day 33):**
```
"Thanks for reaching out! My rate for Reels is R800 based on my engagement and niche expertise.

I'd love to work together - is there flexibility to meet at R700?

Or I could do an Instagram Story series (5 slides) for R400 if that fits your budget better."
```

**Brand response:** "R700 works! Let's do it."

**Result:** R300 more for same work (30 seconds of negotiating!)

**Her lesson:** "I was leaving money on the table. Now I negotiate EVERY deal."

## ⚠️ Negotiation Mistakes

❌ **Accepting first offer immediately** → Signal you'd work for less  
✅ **Counter at least once** → Shows you value your work

❌ **Apologizing for your rates** → Weak position  
✅ **Stating rates confidently** → Strong position

❌ **Negotiating via long back-and-forth** → Wastes time  
✅ **2-3 messages max** → Efficient

❌ **Getting emotional** → Unprofessional  
✅ **Stay calm and fact-based** → Professional

❌ **Burning bridges** → Never know when they'll come back  
✅ **Always polite, even declining** → Future opportunities

---

## 💰 When to Walk Away

**Walk away if:**
- Offer is less than 50% your rate
- Brand is disrespectful
- They want unlimited revisions
- Payment terms are sketchy
- Your values don't align

**It's okay to say no. Protects your brand and mental health.**
