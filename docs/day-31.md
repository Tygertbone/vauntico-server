# Day 31: Rate Card Creation 💎

## STOP GUESSING YOUR WORTH. SET YOUR RATES.

**When brands ask "What do you charge?" you need a confident answer.**

**Today: Create your rate card - your professional pricing sheet.**

---

## 🎯 What is a Rate Card?

**Rate card = Document listing your services and prices**

**Why you need one:**
- ✅ Looks professional (brands take you seriously)
- ✅ Saves time (no negotiating from scratch every time)
- ✅ Sets clear boundaries (you control pricing)
- ✅ Shows confidence (you know your value)

---

## 💰 Rate Card Formula

**Base rate calculation:**

**(Followers ÷ 100) × Engagement Rate × 10 = Base Rate**

**Example:**
- 800 followers
- 6% engagement rate
- (800 ÷ 100) × 6 × 10 = R480 base rate

**Adjust based on:**
- Platform (Instagram pays more than TikTok)
- Content type (video > static post)
- Usage rights (can they repost? Adds 30-50%)
- Exclusivity (can't promote competitors? Adds 50-100%)

## 🤝 How to Negotiate

### **When brand says: "That's too expensive"**

**Option #1: Offer package deal**
"I can do 3 videos for R[X] instead of R[Y] individually - saves you R[Z]!"

**Option #2: Remove deliverables**
"I can do R[lower price] if we reduce to 1 video instead of 2."

**Option #3: Ask their budget**
"What budget did you have in mind? Let me see what I can create for that."

**Option #4: Stand firm (if lowballing)**
"I understand budget constraints, but my rates reflect the value and reach I provide. Let me know if you'd like to move forward!"

---

### **When to say NO:**

🚫 If offer is less than 50% of your rate  
🚫 If they want 10 videos for R500  
🚫 If they ask for free work with "exposure"  
🚫 If brand doesn't align with your values

**Your time and audience trust are VALUABLE. Don't undercharge.**

## 🌍 Real Example: Amara's Rate Card Success

**Amara** (Finance niche, 1,200 followers, Nigeria)

**Month 2: No rate card**
- Brands asked: "What do you charge?"
- She said: "Um... R300?"
- Closed deal: R300

**Month 3: Created rate card**
- Same brand asked again
- She sent professional rate card showing R800 for 1 video
- Brand said: "Great, let's do it"
- Closed deal: R800

**Same work. R500 more. Just by having clear rates.**

**Month 4:**
- Brand asked for 4 videos/month
- She offered Silver Package (R3,000/month)
- They accepted
- Now makes R3,000/month from ONE brand

**Her lesson:** "Rate card made me look professional. Brands pay professionals more."

## ⚠️ Rate Card Mistakes

❌ **Charging R50 per post** → Signals no value  
✅ **Minimum R300 per post** → Respectable rate

❌ **Listing every possible service** → Overwhelming  
✅ **3-5 main offerings** → Clear choices

❌ **Never updating rates** → You stay underpaid  
✅ **Raise rates every 3-6 months** → As you grow, rates grow

❌ **Apologizing for your rates** → Shows lack of confidence  
✅ **State rates confidently** → "My rate for this is R800"

---
