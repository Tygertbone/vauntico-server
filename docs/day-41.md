## 💰 The 80/20 Rule for Creators

**80% of your income comes from 20% of your activities.**

**Your job: Identify the 20%, eliminate the 80%.**

---

### **High-Value Activities (20% of time, 80% of income):**

✅ **Creating content** (2-3 hours/week)  
✅ **Engaging with audience** (3-4 hours/week)  
✅ **Pitching brands** (1-2 hours/week)  
✅ **Selling products/services** (2-3 hours/week)

**Total: 10-12 hours/week**

---

### **Low-Value Activities (80% of time, 20% of income):**

❌ **Perfecting content** (diminishing returns)  
❌ **Scrolling TikTok** ("research" = procrastination)  
❌ **Tweaking website** (no one's on your website)  
❌ **Learning more courses** (action > education at this point)

**These feel productive but don't make money.**

## 🚀 Time-Blocking Strategy

**What is time-blocking?**  
Dedicating specific time slots to specific tasks. No multitasking.

---

### **Example: Monday 9-11am Block**

**❌ Wrong way:**

- 9:00am: Check emails
- 9:15am: Scroll Instagram
- 9:30am: Start planning content
- 9:45am: Get distracted by DMs
- 10:00am: Back to planning
- 10:30am: Check TikTok trends
- 11:00am: Only planned 3 videos (incomplete)

---

**✅ Right way:**

- 9:00am: Set timer for 1 hour
- 9:00-10:00am: ONLY plan content (phone on Do Not Disturb)
- 10:00am: Break (5 min)
- 10:05am: Set timer for 1 hour
- 10:05-11:05am: ONLY pitch brands
- 11:05am: Done! (7 videos planned, 5 brands pitched)

---

**The power of time-blocking:**

- Forces focus
- Eliminates distraction
- Gets more done in less time

---

## 📱 The "Deep Work" vs "Shallow Work" Split

### **Deep Work (Requires focus):**

- Content creation
- Writing sales copy
- Strategy planning

**Do this:** Morning (9am-12pm) when energy is high

---

### **Shallow Work (Low focus needed):**

- Responding to DMs
- Scheduling posts
- Commenting on other posts

**Do this:** Afternoon/evening (can do while tired)

---

## ⚠️ Time Wasters to Eliminate

### **Time Waster #1: Perfectionism**

"This video isn't perfect, let me re-film it 5 times"

**Reality:** 80% quality posted > 100% quality never posted

**Fix:** 2-take rule. If it's good enough after 2 takes, move on.

---

### **Time Waster #2: "Research" Scrolling**

"I'm studying the algorithm!" (scrolls for 2 hours)

**Reality:** You're procrastinating.

**Fix:** 15-minute daily limit for "research." Set a timer.

---

### **Time Waster #3: Saying Yes to Everything**

Every collab, every opportunity, every DM conversation.

**Reality:** Your time = your most valuable asset.

**Fix:** Say no to anything that doesn't move you toward R2K goal.

---

### **Time Waster #4: Unfocused DM Conversations**

Chatting with followers for hours about random topics.

**Reality:** Friendly, but not income-generating.

**Fix:** Be helpful, but brief. "That's a great question! I actually cover this in my [product]. Want the link?"

---

## 🧠 The "One Thing" Rule

**Every day, ask:**  
**"What's the ONE thing I can do today that will move me closest to R2K?"**

**Answer that. Do that. Everything else is optional.**

---

**Examples:**

**Monday:** "Pitch 5 brands" (could land R800 deal)  
**Tuesday:** "Batch film 7 videos" (content for entire week)  
**Wednesday:** "Follow up with 3 interested leads" (could close R500 in sales)

**Focus on the ONE thing. Don't get distracted by 50 things.**

## 📊 Time Audit Exercise

**Track how you spend time THIS week:**

| Activity                 | Time Spent | Income Generated?    |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Creating content         | 5 hours    | Yes (views = sales)  |
| Scrolling social media   | 8 hours    | No                   |
| Responding to DMs        | 3 hours    | Yes (leads to sales) |
| Perfecting video editing | 4 hours    | Minimal              |
| Pitching brands          | 1 hour     | Yes (future income)  |

**Total: 21 hours**  
**Income-generating: 9 hours**  
**Wasted: 12 hours**

**Eliminate the 12 hours. Free up half your week!**
