## 🎓 The Vauntico Voice Guide

### Tone Principles

1. **Mythic, not mystical** — Epic but grounded
2. **Empowering, not preachy** — Inspire, don't lecture
3. **Specific, not vague** — Metrics, stories, real names
4. **Legacy-focused, not hype-driven** — Build for generations

### Words to Use Often

- Forge, ritual, scroll, lore, covenant
- Ascension, transformation, empire, legacy
- Sacred, enshrined, artifact, vault
- Ownership, independence, sovereignty

### Words to Avoid

- Disrupt, revolutionize, game-changer (overused)
- Leverage, synergy, ecosystem (corpo-speak)
- Easy, simple, effortless (diminishes craft)
- Free forever, unlimited (unsustainable promises)

### When in Doubt

Ask: "Would this sentence survive 100 years?"  
If not, make it more mythic.
