## The Revelation

You've climbed the mountain. You've earned your scars. You know things others would pay to learn.

The world is drowning in information. What it craves is _transformation_.  
Workshops that don't just lecture—they **awaken**.  
Systems that don't just inform—they **forge disciples**.

**The Workshop Kit is your blueprint for scaled wisdom.**
