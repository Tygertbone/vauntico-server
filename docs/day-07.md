# Day 7: Week 1 Review 🎉

## YOU DID IT!

**7 days ago you were thinking about starting. Today you're a CREATOR.**

Let's review what you accomplished:

---

## 📊 Your Week 1 Wins

✅ **Day 1:** Found your profitable niche  
✅ **Day 2:** Built a zero-dollar studio  
✅ **Day 3:** Wrote 3 viral scripts  
✅ **Day 4:** Filmed your first video  
✅ **Day 5:** Edited like a pro  
✅ **Day 6:** Posted and went LIVE  
✅ **Day 7:** You're here reviewing (showing up = 80% of success)

**That's MORE than 95% of "aspiring creators" ever do.**

## 📈 Analyzing Your First Video

Open your video and check:

**Views:** ______ (anything above 50 = good start!)  
**Likes:** ______ (2-5% of views = normal)  
**Comments:** ______ (any comment = engagement win!)  
**Followers gained:** ______ (even 1 = success!)

**What the numbers mean:**

- **0-50 views:** Normal for Day 1. Post 2 more this week.
- **50-500 views:** Great! Algorithm is testing you. Keep posting.
- **500+:** VIRAL POTENTIAL! Analyze what worked, do more of that.

**Low numbers? DON'T QUIT.**  
- Amara's first video: 23 views
- Thabo's first video: 11 views
- Wanjiku's first video: 47 views

**They all now make R5K+/month.**
