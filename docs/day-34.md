## 📊 Week 5 Key Lessons

### **Lesson #1: Brand Deals = Game Changer**
One R800 brand deal = same as selling 4-5 digital products.  
**Brand partnerships scale income fast.**

### **Lesson #2: Negotiation Matters**
R500 offer → R800 close = R300 more for 2 minutes of negotiation.  
**Always counter. Always.**

### **Lesson #3: Portfolio Opens Doors**
Brands want to see past work.  
**Your content = your resume.**

### **Lesson #4: Professionalism = Higher Rates**
Rate card + media kit = taken seriously.  
**Presentation = perception = payment.**

### **Lesson #5: Follow-Up Wins Deals**
Most brands don't respond first time.  
**One polite follow-up = 30% more responses.**
