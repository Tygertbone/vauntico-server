## ⚠️ Manual Steps Required

Due to Railway CLI interactive mode limitations, the following steps need to be completed manually:

### 1. Railway Deployment

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Login with tyatjamesd@gmail.com
3. Select/create `vauntico-server-v2` project
4. Connect GitHub repo: `Tygertbone/vauntico-mvp`
5. Set deployment root to: `server-v2/`
6. Configure environment variables from `.env.example`
7. Deploy the service

### 2. Domain Configuration

1. Add custom domain: `api.vauntico.com`
2. Get Railway TXT verification record
3. Configure Namecheap DNS with `_railway` TXT record
4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)

### 3. Health Verification

Run: `.\scripts\test-vauntico-api-health.ps1`

## 📋 Expected Results

### DNS Configuration

```
Namecheap TXT Record:
Host: _railway.api
Value: railway-verification=[VALUE_FROM_RAILWAY]
TTL: 1 hour
```

### Health Endpoint

```bash
curl https://api.vauntico.com/health
Expected Response: {"status":"ok"}
Expected Status: HTTP 200
```

## 🔧 Current Configuration Files

### server-v2/railway.toml

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm install && npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[environments.production]
NODE_ENV = "production"
PORT = "8080"
```

### server-v2/src/routes/health.ts

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
const router = Router();
router.get("/health", (req, res) => res.status(200).json({ status: "ok" }));
export default router;
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Complete Manual Deployment**: Follow `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_MANUAL_GUIDE.md`
2. **Configure Domain**: Add `api.vauntico.com` with proper DNS records
3. **Verify Health**: Run test script to confirm deployment success
4. **Monitor Setup**: Configure uptime monitoring and alerting
5. **Update Documentation**: Update API docs with new endpoint URLs

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Build Failures**: Check environment variables and Railway logs
- **Domain Issues**: Verify TXT record configuration and propagation
- **Health Failures**: Check if PORT=8080 matches application config
