## 💡 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW

### ✅ What's Working

- Regional pricing (USD/ZAR)
- Access gates (paywalls)
- All navigation
- Mobile responsive design
- SEO tags for social sharing

### ⚠️ MVP Limitations (Intentional)

- Payment buttons are placeholders
- Sign in/up doesn't work (no backend yet)
- Access control uses localStorage (temporary)

**This is NORMAL for MVP!** Phase 2 will add the backend.
